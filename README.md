# C++ Learning Repository

This repository is a part of my journey through learning C++ programming. It contains various exercises and projects that cover basic to more advanced aspects of the C++ language.

## Featured Projects

### Lost Bermuda (`LostBermuda.cpp`)

Dive into the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle with this naval battle simulation. Choose your side – pirates or the royal fleet – and engage in a fierce battle for control. The game is played on a grid where players take turns to target and sink the opponent's ships. This program showcases basic C++ syntax, control structures, and random number generation.

### Password Generator (`passwort_generator.cpp`)

Secure your secrets with randomly generated passwords. This simple application generates a password of a given length using a mix of characters and symbols. It demonstrates file handling in C++, random number generation, and working with STL vectors.

### Secret Santa (`wichtel.cpp`)

Organize your holiday gift exchange with this Secret Santa program. Enter participant names and let the program randomly assign who buys a gift for whom. It's a great example of vector usage, file output, and randomness in C++.

## Basic Concepts

The repository also includes numerous smaller programs that I've used to practice and understand the following C++ concepts:

- Basic syntax and structure (`hello_world.cpp`)
- Control flow (`break_continue.cpp`)
- Enumerations (`enums.cpp`)
- Function overloading (`functions_overload.cpp`)
- Working with strings (`strings.cpp`)
- Ternary operators (`ternary_operator.cpp`)
- Pointers and array manipulation (`pointers.cpp`)
- Mathematical operations and applications (`maths.cpp`)
- ...and more.

Each program is a stepping stone towards mastering C++, documenting the progress from simple to complex programming scenarios.

## Running the Programs

To run any of the programs, you'll need a C++ compiler such as `g++`. Compile a program with the following command:

```sh
g++ -o output_name source_file.cpp
´´´
Then run the compiled executable:
```sh
./output_name
´´´
Replace output_name with your desired executable name and source_file.cpp with the source file you're compiling.
